# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
Description:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a
numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a
fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in
developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

Key Concepts and Challenges:

1.Data Collection: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for
prediction.

2.Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle
missing values, and ensure data quality.

3.Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.

4.Model Training: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., ScikitLearn).

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using
metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.

6.Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and
actual values.
